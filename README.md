Rmd template for UNC dissertation

This will contain files to create a formatted dissertation according to [UNC graduate school standards](http://gradschool.unc.edu/academics/thesis-diss/guide/). All of the code elements are modified versions from other people. The Rmd parts derive from [https://github.com/jvcasill/ua_thesis_rmd](https://github.com/jvcasill/ua_thesis_rmd) and the UNC formatting .cls file from [https://github.com/mmalahe/unc-dissertation](https://github.com/mmalahe/unc-dissertation). Lastly, the code at [here](https://rosannavanhespenresearch.wordpress.com/2016/02/03/writing-your-thesis-with-r-markdown-1-getting-started/) was also helpful. I am very grateful for their code!
