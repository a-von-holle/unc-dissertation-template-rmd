This is where the body of your abstract goes, limited to 150 words for a thesis, and 350 words for a dissertation or document. The word count limits apply to the regular Abstract in the thesis and to the separate Special Abstract. Use the same text for both; just adjust the margins and heading. The abstract should summarize your work. The UMI booklet listed in the resources section of the U of A manual provides some writing tips. The abstract for a dissertation or document may be longer than one page; word count is more important than page length in this section.

If you are doing a paper submission, submit one copy of the special abstract, and two extra copies of your title page, in the box with the final copies of your thesis. If you are doing an electronic submission, you can ignore the special abstract.
